# ECG-Digitization
A tool developed using python to convert images of ECG's into signals of ECG basically digitize them.
There is a lot of ECG image data all around, if we could digitize all of them we would be able to gather so much of digitized data whic can be further processed or fed easily into machines for any kind of predictions. A digitization system would also enable some of the AI techniques to predict the anomaly present in ECG by just feeding in the ECG image. The system will first digitize the image and later will use some machine learning model to predict the anomaly.
I have designed this pipeline as follows.

The results obtained using above pipeline is as follows.
